1. Git Branching Basics:

    Branching in Git allows you to create multiple versions of your code, isolating changes in specific branches (e.g., feature branches) while keeping the main branch stable.

    The default branch (usually called main) is created during the first commit. New branches can be created to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.
2. Creating and Merging Branches:
    You create a branch using git branch <branch_name>, switch to it using git checkout <branch_name>, or do both at once with git checkout -b <branch_name>.

    After working on a feature branch, you can merge it into the main branch using git merge <branch_name>.
    
    Merge conflicts might arise when different branches modify the same lines of code, which needs to be resolved manually.

3. Branch Management:

    Delete branches that are no longer needed using git branch -d <branch_name> (if merged) or git branch -D <branch_name> (if not merged).
    
    Pushing branches to remote repositories like GitHub allows others to view and work on your code.

4. Rock Paper Scissors UI:

    Add a UI to the Rock Paper Scissors game by creating buttons for player selections and updating the DOM to display the game results instead of using console.log.
    
    Refactor the original game logic to work with event listeners and dynamic updates on the UI.

5. Final Steps:

    After completing changes on a branch (e.g., rps-ui), merge it into the main branch, push the changes to GitHub, and clean up unused branches locally and remotely.

6. Best Practices:

    Use branches for separate features or bug fixes to prevent unstable code from affecting the main branch.

    Regularly push and merge changes after testing to maintain a clean, working codebase.
